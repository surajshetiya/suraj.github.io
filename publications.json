Supporting pattern matching on strings (such as prefix, substring, and suffix) makes this problem much more challenging, thereby necessitating a dedicated study. Traditional approaches often build pruned summary data structures such as tries followed by selectivity estimation using statistical correlations. However, this produces insufficiently accurate cardinality estimates resulting in the selection of sub-optimal plans by the query optimizer. Recently proposed deep learning based approaches leverage techniques from natural language processing such as embeddings to encode the strings and use it to train a model. While this is an improvement over traditional approaches, there is a large scope for improvement. We propose Astrid, a framework for string selectivity estimation that synthesizes ideas from traditional and deep learning based approaches. We make two complementary contributions. First, we propose an embedding algorithm that is query-type (prefix, substring, and suffix) and selectivity aware. Consider three strings 'ab', 'abc' and 'abd' whose prefix frequencies are 1000, 800 and 100 respectively. Our approach would ensure that the embedding for 'ab' is closer to 'abc' than 'abd'. Second, we describe how neural language models could be used for selectivity estimation. While they work well for prefix queries, their performance for substring queries is sub-optimal. We modify the objective function of the neural language model so that it could be used for estimating selectivities of pattern matching queries.

We formally define the problem of fairness-aware range queries as obtaining a fair query which is most similar to the user's query.

For a scoring function and a subset of tuples, the regret of the subset is defined as the (relative) difference in scores between the top-1 tuple of the subset and the top-1 tuple of the entire database. Finding the regretratio minimizing set (RRMS), ie, the subset of a required size k that minimizes the maximum regret-ratio across all possible ranking functions, has been a well-studied problem in recent years. This problem is known to be NP-complete and there are several approximation algorithms for it. Other NP-complete variants have also been investigated, eg, finding the set of size k that minimizes the average regret ratio over all linear functions. Prior work have designed customized algorithms for different variants of the problem, and are unlikely to easily generalize to other variants. In this paper we take a different path towards tackling these problems. In contrast to the prior, we propose a unified algorithm for solving different problem variants. Unification is done by localizing the customization to the design of variant-specific subroutines or \u201coracles\u201d that are called by our algorithm. Our unified algorithm takes inspiration from the seemingly unrelated problem of clustering from data mining, and the corresponding K-MEDOID algorithm.

Recently, a number of learned models have been proposed for this task. Often, these models significantly outperform traditional approaches in terms of accuracy. One of the stumbling blocks that prevents their increased adoption is that the learned models do not quantify the uncertainty of their estimates. It is desirable to associate each cardinality estimate of the model with a prediction interval that will contain the true cardinality with an user-specified probability. The size of the prediction interval encodes the uncertainty allowing the query optimizer to make an informed decision. For example, knowing that the cardinality of a query  lies between 1\u20133% of the relation size with high probability is more informative than a single point estimate of 2%.
